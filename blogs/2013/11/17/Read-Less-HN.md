# Read less HN

Let's break it down. What type of content do you typically read on HN:

+ People having great success with their startup
+ People failing (again) at their Nth startup
+ A wonderful new language that you should learn _immediately_
+ How language X is _way_ better than language Y and why you should 
  rewrite all of your existing, working code immediately
+ A wonderful new framework that you should also learn immediately
+ How X technology product is terrible and made some company go out of business

I think you are starting to get the picture. There are a lot of success stories, a lot
of failure stories, a _ton_ of articles/links about some newfangled technology, and even
more articles about how that new technology is better than what you're currently using in
every way possible. I propose that _most_ of this information is actually doing more
harm than good and that you should attempt to read less HN.

## Why?

### Loss in Productivity

And I'm not just talking about the time you spend at work reading HN. HN is a very easy
way to sink hours of time and get relatively little reward. After you've read about the
20 new frameworks that came out this week, what are you going to do with that knowledge?
Are you going to try each one? Likely the answer is no. If you are at work or working on
a personal project for fun, likely you have already chosen your set of tools and you are
just wasting your time.

If you tend to read more of the "startup stories" on HN, what do you really gain? Will reading
more and more stories about failed and successful startups really teach you everything that
you need to know about running your own startup? And at what point do you start getting
diminishing returns? What is the opportunity cost associated with spending your time reading
100's of "startup stories" each week/month?

### Too Many Good Things

There are a fair number of posts on HN detailing the wonderful success that X random startup /
company has had. Reading too many of these articles may get you feeling depressed about your
own situation. Even if you are running a mildly successful business, you'll still start
to see how your company is failing in one way or another. I'm not saying that is a bad thing,
but I think it would be more beneficial for your company, and for you as a person, to focus
on the things you do well and try to do them even better.

### Too Many Bad Things

The converse of the previous point is that there are a ton of posts detailing the massive
failures in their startup or career that have costs them dearly. Those articles, in and of
themselves, are not a bad thing. It is good to know some of the common pitfalls that you 
may face. However, reading too many of these articles may get some people discouraged when
they should not be. When you read a bunch of these type of articles, you have to ask yourself
what you are getting out of them?

### No Middle Ground

The main reason with the two previous points may just be that there is no strong middle-ground
representation. People seem to talk more about how things went wonderful or horrible.
Likely because that attracts more readership, but it is to the detriment to everyone as
a whole. It also breeds a culture that only wants to talk about the extremes or will exaggerate
the truth to meet those standards.

### Technology ADD

If you're more on the engineering side, and anything like me, you like to get your hands dirty
in just about everything tech related. Personally, I can't get enough of it. However, there is
a point where you want to put a hold on learning every new-fangled language/framework and start
applying your knowledge to build something that you enjoy. However, if you keep subjecting
yourself to the continual stream of technology news, you may have a hard time keeping yourself
focused (How can you _not_ learn each new "LISP of the month"?).

As an added bonus, by digging into less technologies you'll come to master the ones that you
already know which can be a powerful thing. Many people seem to value the polyglot programmer
these days, but you have to determine how far down that path you'd like to go and how much
mastery you'd like to attain in those languages/tools/frameworks.

## The Solution

The solution is not to read absolutely no news at all. Obviously this post was titled "Read
Less HN", so that's not where I'm going with all of this. I'd recommend that you switch to
some sort of aggregated format. Something that can curate the top posts and send them to you
on a schedule. Personally, I subscribe to the [Hacker Newsletter][1] for a weekly update. The
idea of curated content has several benefits

+ The best content is filtered for you, so you spend less time reading uninteresting articles
+ You save time reading a newsletter once a week vs reading the site every day
+ Because you read less articles, you'll avoid hearing about 20 new frameworks a week and ideally
  read about 1'ish which will hopefully be more worthwhile (since it was theoretically filtered
  from the initial 20)

The wonderful part about aggregated content is that you have options. If Hacker Newsletter doesn't
suite you, you could try several other newsletters as well:

+ [Javascript Weekly][2]
+ [Ruby Weekly][3]
+ [PyCoders Weekly][4]
+ [Status Code (General CompSci Weekly News)][5]
+ [Dart Weekly][6]
+ [HTML 5 Weekly][7]

You can also consume multiple newsletters if you'd like but be very careful not to fall back
into the same trap as with HN. Choose carefully and always think about how you're benefiting
from each article that you read.
