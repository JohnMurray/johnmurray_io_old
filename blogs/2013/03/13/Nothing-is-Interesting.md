# Nothing is Interesting

I have a problem. I am young (22) and, as the Internet informs me,
should be filled with ambition and drive. I should be full of fresh ideas
and working on projects that I'm genuinely passionate about.
However… I have a problem. __Nothing is interesting.__

There is a pattern;
I come up with an idea and work on it for a day or two until it's about
40% done. By this point, I have solved the tough challenges and worked
out the mental problems. The only things left are the list of tasks to
complete so that I can say, _"Look, this is complete and it does something
nifty."_ But that task list is not interesting. So… I stop working.

I've been racking my brain lately trying to find something that I will
be passionate about. Something that will continue to be interesting,
but that is a tough game that I am apparently not winning. Perhaps I will
consign myself to writing small, toy programs that can hold my interest
to completion. I'm not sure yet.


### My Question

Does any one else feel this way and, if so, I want to hear your thoughts
on this. What have you done in the past, have you found something that
truly interests you and if so what was it? Or, alternatively, do you find
youself in a similar position with no real solution or do you even consider
this to be a problem? Tweet you're comments at 
`#nothingisinteresting`. Let's start a conversation and see where it
leads us. That is, if anyone finds this interesting...
