Due to my employer's server-configuration, I find myself developing
on remote machines often. However, I find it a pain to setup a dev
environment on every new machine. So, I usually just end up working
local as much as possible via SSH-FS. For anyone else that had to
do this as well, here is a handly little script that will hopefully
help you out (just a little).
