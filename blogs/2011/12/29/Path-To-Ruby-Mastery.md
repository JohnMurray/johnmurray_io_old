# Some Context

I have decided that it is time I start to master a language. For me, it seems like the next logical progression not only for my career goals but also for my intellectual maturation. I've done the school thing (learning mathematical and computer science fundamentals) as well as participated in various research studies (not all of which produced a paper) that has led me to have, in my opinion, a wide breadth of knowledge in programming languages, concepts, paradigms and applications. Now I'm doing the work thing which includes solving mildly difficult problems. Yes, the problem space can be interesting but, it is a very shallow growth from which the company is the only benefactor.

This log entry will serve as a reminder as to the steps I must take to reach the level of mastery. I won't get everything in my first roadmap, but this log entry will likely change. Please keep a lookout at the bottom for any update-notes. 

# The Roadmap

* Re-read [_Design Patterns in Ruby_] [1]
* Read [_Eloquent Ruby_] [2]
* Read [_Metaprogramming Ruby_] [4]
* Study Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord's use of meta-programming and DSLs
* Study the source of [eventmachine] [3] to understand how gems are written in C
* Create a gem in C of moderate complexity
* Find and contribute to an interesting OSS project (in Ruby of course)
* Study various Ruby coding guidelines and create a comprehensive one for myself


Now, although these are quasi-ordered, I can't imagine performing each of these items sequentially. I imagine that I'll skip around and do one or more tasks at a time. The only thing important to me is that I take my time and ensure that the important points are committed to memory. 

If you've read this and feel like I have left something out or have a suggestion, feel free to contact me and we can discuss your idea/opinion.
