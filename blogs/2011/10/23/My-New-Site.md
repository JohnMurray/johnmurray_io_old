Welcome to my new site! If you've ever seen my old site you would probably be appalled and I would be ashamed. So, to rid myself of the embarrassment I have decided to create an entirely new site with a more "natural" feel (or at least I hope). 

This time around I'm keeping a log of my current thoughts, rants, reference-guides, and the like. If this sounds too much like another blog to you and in which you refuse to read then it is too late; you're already reading the first entry. If this does interest you, then stay tuned and perhpas I will write something interesting soon. On here you can also find a link to my all important GitHub page containing my current projects or projects I may be following or hacking on. If you need to get a hold of me you can also find my contact info (if you can't find it, I can't help you).

Well, as you can see, there is not much to the new site and I don't have much else to say. So, enjoy!
