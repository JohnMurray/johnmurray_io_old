As you may, or may not, know I am currently working on my masters in
Computer Science. This means I'm probably a masochist, but it also means that
I get to spend time playing with some toy problems that can be kind of fun. Thus,
the point of my log entry today.

I'm getting ready to work on solving the [Metric k-center][1] problem for my
final project in my AI course. I imagine the solution will contain lots of
magical and nifty techniques like genetic algorithms, wisdom of crowds,
distributed computing (for large problem sizes), etc. It should be a lot of
fun. If this sounds interesting, then check back in a couple weeks or so and I
should have a good writeup of the solution that I have come to. Wait a little
longer and (hopefully) you'll see a mysteriously similar research paper show
up in some random publication on the inter-webs. 

So, consider this the questions for which I will follow up with:

+ What will the solution look like?
+ What approaches will be best utilized for solving/estimating the problem?
+ How fast is it? (because all we care about is speed)
+ What makes my solution better than other existing solutions?
