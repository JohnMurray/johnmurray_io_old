# Who is this for?
So you want to write your own framework? It's a web framework, eh? Well, then
you are my target audience. Yes, that is to say that this blog post is targeted
toward you (just in case you were trying to dodge that bullet). If you're not
contemplating creating a framework, or even better, you are an experienced
creator of frameworks then you'll probably like this as well.

# Getting Started
So, you've experienced a problem or created some solution in which you'd like
to create a framework for or derive a framework from, respectively. Well then,
good for you. You're probably on the right track. You have seen a problem that
could be solved better, and have set out to do just that. So my first piece of
advice as you start down this path is simple, and is as follows:

<div style="text-align: center">
<h3>Don't!</h3>
</div>
<br />

It's quite simple to follow, really. No reason you shouldn't be able to do just
that. 

# Why?
If this is your first framework, then you're probably all giddy to start
working on it. You're excited about the learning experience, about putting
your work out there, about people using it, and _< insert whatever else >_. I've 
been there. I've put quite a bit of work into some _"frameworks"_ that I 
thought would solve all the world's problems. 

So what happened to those frameworks I was working on? I never released them.
For the most part I actually just zipped up the work, put it in my archive, and
I'll probably never look at that code again, let alone actually use the code.
You're probably wondering why. Well, most of the problem is that I didn't
think about what I was doing before I started doing it.

# Creating Clutter
The fact of the matter was, there were already frameworks out there that
solved my problems. Did they solve 100% of the problems I was trying to
solve? No, but they solved about 95-98%. So, is it really worth
it for me to recreate existing work just to make up the 2-5% difference? I think
not. I value my time too much to do that. I want to do interesting work and,
to me, working on an already solved problem is boring.

I fight this battle all the time. I find myself working on a problem that is in
need of some framework and the first thought
is to create it myself. I just love creating things so this is where
my mind heads first, but I have to stop myself. I know that the first thing
I should be doing is seeing what is already out there. See if I can find 
something that solves _most_ of my problems. If so, then that is what I should
be using. 

All these little frameworks out there really just cause a lot of clutter. This
is especially true of web frameworks. I feel like 2 or 3 new frameworks come out
every week. Take Ruby for example. Although most people think of Rails, a quick
Google search for _Ruby web frameworks_ turns up:

+ Rails
+ Sinatra
+ Merb
+ Halcyon
+ Ramaze
+ Webby
+ Pakyow
+ Padrino
+ Camping
+ Vintage
+ Nitro/Og
+ Wuby
+ Ruby WAF
+ Cuba
+ Grape
+ Iowa
+ Mack
+ Maveric
+ Presto
+ Renee
+ ServerSide
+ Waves

That list took me about 3 minutes to compile (mostly just the time to type and
check the spelling). These were not hard to find. Do I know what more than 2
of them are really about? No. If I'm new to the Ruby world, am I going to read
about all of them? No. I'm going to read about the top 3 most-popular and just
pick one I like.

# Creating Great Frameworks
If there are already frameworks out there that solve a large majority of
your problem and if they are fairly popular then, there's probably a reason.
Most likely, they're quite good. It's likely that many people
have added functionality, reviewed and refactored, and tested thoroughly the
framework. 

My suggestion to you, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">clutter</span>
framework creator, is that you contribute to a framework that is already
out there and being used by an audience greater than one. If you think that
there are problems that the frameworks don't solve, then add a patch, create an
extension, etc. Basically, contribute instead of creating clutter.

If you're problem is truly unique and you can justify creating a framework, 
then I don't have any advice for you except this, _If you're going to
clutter my ecosystem, please don't clutter it with garbage.
