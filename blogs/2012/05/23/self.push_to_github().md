The repository for this site is now located on [GitHub][1]. I've been using
the git-repo on Heroku for a while now to act as my central server (to sync
the repository between my various machines). I've been wanting to put this
on GitHub for a while now just because I enjoy the interface more when
browsing through the history and what not. However, I've been putting it off
because the code isn't _pretty_ and I wasn't sure if it was something that
I really wanted to show off. Well, I've realized that it's better to put
stuff out there sometimes then waiting until it is _complete_ (which may
never happen).

It's currently hosted on Heroku and written in Ruby and Sinatra. I use
[Markdown] [2] to write my blog-posts in and [Maruku] [3] to parse them
(although I'm regretting that choice). There is no database for this site
and I don't ever plan to have one. It's completely secure in the fact that
it's read-only. 

If you like the idea of this site, then feel free to use the code (you'll
probably want to re-write the ugly parts). :-)
