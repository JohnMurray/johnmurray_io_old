So, if you've taken a look at FnordMetrics then you know why it's worth
trying out. It's easy to get setup, has a great API for defining your
metrics collection, and is a powerful tool in your platform-analytics
arsenal. If you want to know more about the project, head on over to their
[GitHub] [1] page.


Okay, let's get down to business. I'm going to walk you through getting started
with FnordMetric in your C# project. Why C# you may ask?
