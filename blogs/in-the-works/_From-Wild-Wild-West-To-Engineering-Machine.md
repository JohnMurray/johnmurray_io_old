talk about the steps it takes to go from a wild wild west development house
to a real engineering machine. I'm not really sure what these steps may look
like but so far, I have:

  - Proper deployment environments (dev,staging,prod)
    - consistency in naming
    - correct use
  - Proper testing (unit testing, regression testing)
    - Using tests as your spec (TDD)
    - evloving from no-testing to TDD-like environment
  - CI system
    - get those tests working for you
    - get the most out of your dev environment with automatic deployments
  - Learning
    - invest in your team (books, training, etc.)
  - Hire developers with varrying backgrounds (if possible)
    - diversify your team's experience so they can all learn from each other
