# The Series
Okay, so I've split this blog post into three parts. Don't worry, all of the
posts have already been written. I am splitting up the posts so that my readers
( _you_ ) can feel accomplished as they work there way through the sections.
Sometimes one Ã¼ber-long post can feel a little daunting. I've split it up as
follows:

- What is \[a] geofence/geofencing? \[[_this_][1] post]
- How to build your own geofence-server with Ruby and Mongo \[[link][2]]
- A walk-through of a sample geofence-server, built just for you \[[link][3]]

Let's get started shall we.



# What is \[a] Geofence/Geofencing?
## General Description
A geofence is a conceptual fence around some geographically defined area. For
example, the company I am currently working for deals in car-centric telemetry.
Specifically, we process a lot of geo-spatial data. We use this to allow users
to create a conceptual fence around their car (a geofence). When the car
reports outside of the fence, we can send them a notification. 

This is useful for making sure your car isn't stolen, tracking your children,
setting reminders for yourself, etc. If the idea of a conceptual fence is
still a little fuzzy, I'll draw you a pretty picture:

## So Why Geofences?
talk about how spatially-aware apps are the future what with the rise
of mobile computing and possibly advertising and all that jazz


## Computing Methods
Talk about various way of implementing a goefence
- break fences into grids
- ray-tracing algorithsm for point-in-polygon algorithms
- ??

Also, give some links to some geo-spatial indexing algorithms just
for completeness.


## Available Services
just to finish things off, talk about available geofencing services
