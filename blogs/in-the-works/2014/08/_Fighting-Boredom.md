# Fighting Boredom

Back at the beginning of 2013, I wrote about how nothing was really holding my
interest. I was bored and I wasn't sure what to do about it. I still fight the
same battles of boredom but I've learned some lessons along the way and I'd
like to share them. I'll say up front though that this has nothing about avoiding
boredom at work, although you may find some of the thoughts useful to your
situation.


## Don't do things because you think you __shoudl__

+ contributing to github
+ learning fad languages and frameworks


## Don't try to force anything

along the same lines as the previous point, but don't try to do things because
you think you __should__ be interested in them. You have to find things that you
are truly interested in.
